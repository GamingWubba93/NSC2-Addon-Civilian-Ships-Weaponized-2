[list]
[*]New ships for colonziers, construction, science vessels

[list]
[*]Savegame Compatible
[*]Not Ironman Compatible
[*]I made changes to multiple vanilla game files so it probably is not compatible with any mods that alter ships or ship components. Be aware that the AI will use this also in your game.
